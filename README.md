# Sigmoid_MLP

Assignment for my Intro To AI Module. 

Can create a MLP with N input, 1 Hidden Layer with M number Neurons, and O number outputs

Uses sigmoid activation function

Uses Average mean square error cost function and cross entropy cost function

generic_MLP can ceate an MLP with as many neurons you want and as many hidden layers you want

    input_size = 30
    hidden_layer_sizes = [70,70]
    output_size = 1

    mlp = generic_MLP(input_size, hidden_layer_sizes, output_size)
